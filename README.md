Introduction
============

One day at the office of the Cecil Pitt Theatrical Agency...

Cecil and Clive are contemplating the state of their lives after a recent escapade in the theatre business has gone bankrupt. Luckily, Cecil still has some money left from his aunt Mabel's will.
"Rock Music, that's where the money is! Yeah, we'll start a rock management business", bellows Cecil.
"Let's form a band", Clive responds.
And the rest is rock and roll history... or is it?
