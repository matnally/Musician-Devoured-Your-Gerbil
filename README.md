Introduction
============

One day at the office of the Cecil Pitt Theatrical Agency...

Cecil and Clive are contemplating the state of their lives after a recent escapade in the theatre business has gone bankrupt. Luckily, Cecil still has some money left from his aunt Mabel's will.
"Rock Music, that's where the money is! Yeah, we'll start a rock management business", bellows Cecil.
"Let's form a band", Clive responds.
And the rest is rock and roll history... or is it?

The aim of the game is to achieve ???

Gifts
=====
The monotony of touring or the tedium of practicing can deflate a musician's HAPPINESS. No matter how small or cheap, a gift can go a long way to help a musician perk up and become their normal insane self again.

Publicity
=========
"Any publicity's good publicity", explains Clive. He is indeed correct... however, publicity good or bad could lead to all kinds of consequences. For example, a musician could be spotted wearing the latest fashion on a night out. This could lead to a fashion label wanting to sponsor that musician for a ludarius amount of money to wear their clothes. Alternatively, that musician could die from a suspected overdose on the same night out. You just don't know! That's the fun of it.
